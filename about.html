        <h1>OUR LEGACY</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout his youth in Calabria, Frankie Bastone grew up in a large family that shared hearty meals made with vegetables from their garden. Taking their mother’s recipes, he and his younger brother packed up and moved to America. Frankie and Johnnie saved their money with the dream of opening an Thai restaurant that would serve family-style food like they had enjoyed and cooked back home. In 1969 Frankie and Johnnie opened a storefront restaurant in the Bronx where a saloon once stood. Unable to afford a new sign, the name “H-thai-Ml” stuck. As word about Frankie’s cooking continued to spread, The Thai Restaurant was transformed from the Bronx’s “best kept secret,” to the landmark restaurant it is today. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
        <h1>STANDING THE TEST OF TIME</h1>
        <p>Over forty years since the original Frankie & Johnnie’s H-Thai-ML hosted droves of celebrities, Yankee players, New York notables and locals alike, guests find an old school vibe with a modern edge. Frankie and Johnnie’s H-Thai-ML honors old world Thai roots, life style, food, and décor. Designed to be an inviting, convivial restaurant and bar for locals and visitors alike.</p>
